Machine 1 mechanics: searches for every single possible pattern at the start of the game (after the first move to be
lighter), then while playing for every player (machine2) move it searches the next move the has the highest prob. of
winning (by counting final results after its move for every possible move it can do). the next move with the highest
value is considered with double probability
